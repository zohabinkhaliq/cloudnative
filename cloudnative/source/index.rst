Cloud Native Architecture
=========================

Technology is constantly evolving and is now one of the foundations of our everyday
lives. Computerization, digitalization, and the Internet have brought us to the
information age we live in. Nowadays, nearly every kind of business requires information
technology to exist and grow. Software is employed to serve a diverse range of business,
technical, and industrial processes, while hardware is used to run the software, store
data, and provide interconnectivity.

Core Cloud Capabilities 
***********************

The way individual cloud resource types are grouped together depends
on choices made by a particular cloud provider. **Usually, you will see four core cloud
capabilities typically referenced as cloud services, no matter how global or niche a cloud
provider is.**

* Compute
* Networking
* Storage

-------------------------------------------------  
  Compute        Networking    
=============   =================================
This is easy    This has great results  
This is large   It is easy in use  
This is small   It acts like a robot 
This is great   People have learned alot from it

*The Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a popular family of protocols for communicating with I/O devices, especially storage devices. (…)
The iSCSI protocol (…) describes a means of transporting SCSI packets over
TCP/IP*
